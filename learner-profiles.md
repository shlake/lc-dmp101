The ideal student for this lesson is a librarian or library science student, who has already worked in a library and has some experience with reference (either on the job, or through a graduate course). In this lesson we go over data specific library skills, but assume knowledge of general library practices like the reference interview.

Additionally, this lesson is aimed at librarians who are interested in either transitioning to data librarianship or who want to add data services to their library's offerings for patrons.
